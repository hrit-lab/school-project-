        <BR>
         13) Registration – Your vehicle’s registration plate should be visible at all times. In case it is broken or damaged, you need to get it replaced at the earliest. Driving a vehicle with its registration number not being visible is a serious offence.
        <BR>

        <BR>

        Road traffic safety refers to the methods and measures used to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured. In a survey conducted by our team , we have found out that 90% people in India have been affected by traffic badly and 80% of them feel unsafe on the roads of Bangalore alone.
In our city  , we feel that the main cause of this issue is due to the bad roads and horribly managed traffic system. In order to inculcate a sense of good road safety , we must first improve our traffic sense. Increasing flyovers, Metro rail and making public transport more useful. Planning the growth of city by leaving provisions for future expansion of city and increased vehicular density can contribute immensely to road safety in newly developing parts of Bangalore. The government should take quick decisions and pay more attention on the poor roads of Bangalore especially Main Roads, The traffic is also increasing due to the conditions of roads or construction. The constructions of flyovers affect a lot and to decrease it the constructions should be done in a faster manner and government can take this step to decrease at least the traffic which results in accidents too.
